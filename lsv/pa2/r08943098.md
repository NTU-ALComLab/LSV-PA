## Topic
Unateness checking of global PI/PO.

## Implementation
The unateness of for each primary output in terms of all primary inputs are reasoned with SAT solver.

Pseudo code

```
for each PO:
    Get transitive fanin cone
    Create SAT instance
    for each Pi:
        Solve(Fx' ^ ~Fx)  // UNSAT if positive unate 
        Solve(~Fx' ^  Fx) // UNSAT if negative unate
    Get PIs which are not transtive fanin of cone
    Print
```
Part of the APIs used are listed as follows:

```
Abc_NtkCreateCone(): get cone of some PO
Abc_NtkToDar(): get AIG from network
Cnf_Derive(): get CNF from AIG
Cnf_DataLift(): corrects the variable ID when added to SAT solver
sat_solver_solve(): solve with assumptions
```
Here incremental solving is applied. A single solver is built and each PI is iterated through changing assumptions. Also, to further speed up the solving, we break down each PO, that is, a single solver is built for each cone. This scales down the CNF effectively, and allows it to solve two more cases (11 -> 13 cases).

## Experimental results
The experimental results on EPFL benchmarks are as follows. We compare our implementation "lsv_print_pounate" to the ABC built-in BDD-based "print_unate" command. The remaining 7 benchmarks are included and the time limit is 12 hours.

The columns from left to right represents the type of the benchmark, name of the benchmark, number of PI, number of PO, AIG node size, AIG level, runtime of "lsv_print_pounate", shared BDD size of "print_unate", and runtime of "print_unate".

It can be seen that BDD-based implementation solves small benchmarks faster than SAT-based method. However, as the benchmarks grow larger, the size of BDD blow up, resulting in inefficient solving. Also, the solving of arithmetic circuits are harder than solving random control circuits.
