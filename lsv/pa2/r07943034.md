# Programming Assignment 2 : Testing Unateness of Primary Outputs

Problem description is on this [**README**](https://github.com/NTU-ALComLab/LSV-PA/blob/master/lsv/pa2/README.md)

## Implementation

For each primary output, it can be treated as a single output function with respect to its supports. To derive the unate information for each primary output in terms of all primary inputs, we can prove the unate property by finding a counter example using SAT solver. 

We say that a primary output _f_ is _positive unate_ in terms of a primary input _x_ if its function _F_ (encoded by the AIG) satisfies _F(...,x=0,...) &rarr; F(...,x=1,...)_. The counter example will be _F(...,x=0,...) > F(...,x=1,...)_, that is, _F(...,x=0,...)==1 and F(...,x=1,...)==0_. Similarly, negative unate can be proved by this method.

The derivation steps are described as following :
