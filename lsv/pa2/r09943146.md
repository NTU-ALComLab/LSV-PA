### Implementations

##### Algorithm
-	In short, I implement the baseline approach as my algorithm.
1. Convert a network to Aig circuit.
2. Duplicate two cnfs, one for positive cofactor and another for negative cofactor.
3. Put the CNF into sat solver.
4. Add new variables to controll the equivalence of PI variables and construct a alpha table to record the variables.
5. By incremental SAT solving, use assumptions to controll the formula. 
5. Run `sat_solver_solve()`  to check each PI unateness of each PO iteratively.

##### Data Structures
- Construct a vector called _allPINames to record all PI object names in the network.
- To one PO, since some PIs may not be used, construct a local vector resized as the same size of global PI numbers. This local vector is used to store unateness info of each PI to this single PO. Use the iterator to get the same position as global PI and store the corresponding unateness information. At last, just check the value of the local vector to get the unateness property.
