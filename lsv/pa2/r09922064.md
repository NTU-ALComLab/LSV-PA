## Theory
If a function f(..., x, ...) is the positive unate in x if and only if 
f(..., x = 0, ...) → f(..., x = 1, ...) is tautology.

```
    f(..., x = 0, ...) → f(..., x = 1, ...)
≡  ¬f(..., x = 0, ...) ﹀ f(..., x = 1, ...)
≡ ¬(f(..., x = 0, ...) ﹀ ¬f(..., x = 1, ...))
```

Therefore, f is the positive unate in x is and only if
f(..., x = 0, ...) ﹀ ¬f(..., x = 1, ...) is unsatisfiable.

## Implementation

### Convert to AIG
The input network is in format `Abc_Ntk_t`.
We convert it into the equivalent AIG structure in format `Aig_Man_t` with function `Abc_NtkToDar()`.

### Convert to CNF
Then, we convert the network into equivalent CNF structure in format `Cnf_Dat_t` with function `Cnf_Derive()`.
Since we need to solve positive cofactor and negative cofactor at the same time.
We duplicate the CNF structure by `Cnf_DataDup()` and use `Cnf_DataLift()` to change the variable of the new CNF structure.

### Create SAT
Then, we add the two CNF structures into the sat solver in format `sat_solver` with function `Cnf_DataWriteUntoSolver()` and `Cnf_DataWriteUntoSolverInt()`.
Because the input node of the positive and negative cofactor should be the same except the cofactor variable, we use function `sat_solver_add_buffer_enable()` to introduce extra variables to assert the equivalence of the input node.

### Solve SAT
Suppose we are now test whether the output variable O is positive unate in input variable I.
We add some extra assumptions into solver.
Variable O should be false and true in the two CNF structure respectively.
Variable I should be false and true in the two CNF structure respectively for positive unate.
The variables for assert equivalence of the input are true except which for I.
Then we solve it with function `sat_solver_solve()`. 
If the result is UNSAT, O is positive unate in I.

### Compute Results
For any primary outputs, for any primary inputs, we test whether it is positive/negative unate or not.
Then we use C standard library `qsort()` to sort the results and print them.

## Optimization
1. Version 1 implement the algorithm descripted above.
2. Version 2 use the function `Abc_NtkCreateCone()` and set flag `fUseAllCis` true to compute the cone of a primary output before convert it into `Aig_Man_t`.
Since we set flag true, the output cone will use all primary inputs. Therefore, we do not need to change the later part of the implementation.
The cone can reduce the variable in the sat solver, but need to create solver for different output.
3. Version 3 also use the function `Abc_NtkCreateCone()` but set flag `fUseAllCis` false. The output cone now contain only necessary inputs.
This flag further reduce the variable in the sat solver.
But now the algorithm need to check whether the input variable is in the cone or not.
If a variable I is not in the cone of O. That means O is both positive and negative unate in I.
