## Implementation

- For each primary outputs, use `Abc_NtkCreateCone` to get the transitive fanin cone of this PO.
Note that I assign false to the `fUseAllCis` parameter. Which will delete all non-support PI. For
the non-support PI, they are both positive unate and negative unate.

- When using `Abc_NtkCreateCone`, we have to consider the complement of the PO. I use `Abc_ObjFaninC0` to
check if the PO is complemented, if so, I use `Abc_ObjSetFaninC` to complement the PO of the cone.

- I use `Abc_NtkToDar` to convert `Abc_Ntk_t` to `Aig_Man_t`. Note that `Abc_NtkToDar` is not included in
any header files, we have to extern the function using `extern "C"`.

- I'm Using `Cnf_Derive` to convert `Aig_Man_t` into `Cnf_Dat_t` and using `Cnf_DataDup` to copy a set of
`Cnf_Dat_t`. However we have to use two set of variables for two CNF data, `Cnf_DataLift` can solve
this problem.

- We can use `Cnf_CnfForClause` to iterate through to the CNF clause add add the clause into the
solver by `sat_solver_addclause`

- We have to add the buffer variable for the incremental SAT solving. I use `sat_solver_addvar` to
get a new SAT variable and use `sat_solver_add_buffer_enable` to create to buffer clause.

- Then we have to assign assumption for to call the `sat_solver_solve`. We have to transfer the
solver variable to literal variable by `toLitCond`.

- If the result is UNSAT, the PI is positive unate(or negative unate).
