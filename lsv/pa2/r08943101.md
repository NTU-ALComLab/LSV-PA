## Algorithm Flow
```
for each PO in input network
  create PO's cone (Abc_NtkCreateCone)
  check the negativity of the PO (Abc_NtkPo, Abc_ObjFaninC0)
  obtain AIG circuit from the cone (Abc_NtkToDar)
  derive CNF formula from the AIG circut and named it F1 (Cnf_Derive)
  duplicate a CNF formula and named it F2 (Cnf_DataDup)
  increments F2's variables by the number of variables (Cnf_DataLift)
  initialize the SAT solver and add clauses (Cnf_DataWriteIntoSolver, sat_solver_addclause)
  for each PI in AIG circuit
    create a enabling variable
    adds clauses to assert the equivalence for the variables in F1 and F2 that represent the PI (sat_solver_add_buffer_enable)
  end
  simply the SAT solver (sat_solver_simplify)

  //solve the unateness
  for each PI in AIG circuit
    1. set the PO assumption that ensure F1 = 1 and F2 = 0
    2. set the cofactor assumption
      i. test positive unate: PI = 0 in F1, PI = 1 in F2
     ii. test negative unate: PI = 1 in F1, PI = 0 in F2
    3. set the enableing variable assumption
      i. cofactor's enableing variable = 0
     ii. other's enableing variable = 1
    4. solve the SAT problem (sat_solver_solve)
  end
  
  for each PI in input network sorted by node id in ascending order
    print the unateness result
  end
end
```
## Optimization over the Baseline Approach
* The only difference in solving positive unate and negative unate is the negativity of the cofactor
  * In baseline approach, the difference in solving positive unate and negative unate is setting the difference assumption to control F1 and F2. However, after the experiment, I find that setting cofactor's assumption is more efficient.
* Eliminate unused PI in the cone
  * In function Abc_NtkCreateCone(), we have two options to crate cone for a node, one is keepping all the PI, another is eliminating the unused PI. The node ID in first option is same as the original network. However, in our algorithm flow, we also create variables for these PI and thus reducing the efficiency.
## Encouraged Topic
* Can your implementation solve the remaining 7 test
cases?
  * No, my program can not solve these test cases.
* What are the differences between random control and
arithmetic circuits? Which category is more challenging?
  * Arithmetic circuits have more computations and thus having more internal nodes (i.e. more variables) and more clauses. Therefore, arithmetic circuits are more challenging.
