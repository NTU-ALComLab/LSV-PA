## Implementation Flow
1. Use `Abc_NtkCreateCone()` to create cone for each primary output
2. Use `Abc_NtkToDar` to create aig graph
3. Use `Cnf_Derive` to derive CNF formula from an aig graph
4. Use `Cnf_DataLift` to make two CNF formula have different variables
5. Create clauses `a + ~x + x'` and `a + x + ~x'` for control the same varible in the two CNF formula
6. Create clauses `y` and `~y` for output (make F(x) ^ ~F(x'))
7. Use `sat_solver_addclause` add all clauses into a sat solver
8. If `sat_solver_addclause` failed, means it is UNSATIFIABLE (all input variables are both positive unate and negative unate)
9. Solve with assumption `~x and x` or `x and ~x` to check positive unate and negative unate

## Additional Memory Use
* Constuct a clause set to record control input variables of two CNF formula
* Construct a clause set to force output of two CNF formula are oppositive

## SAT Solver
* Add all clauses by `sat_solver_addclause`
* If `sat_solver_addclause` failed, the clauses are contradiction. All input variables are both positive unate and negative unate for this primary output
* UNSATIFIABLE means `F(x) ^ ~F(x')` never occurs. Depending on the assumption of input variables, it could mean either positive unate or negative unate

## Iteration 
* Number of doing sat solving = sum(number of PI of each PO)
