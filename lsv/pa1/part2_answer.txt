2. [ABC Boolean Function Representations]
(a)
1. aig vs strash
aig – Converts only local functions of the nodes to AIGs. But the circuit remains to be store in the "logic" network.
strash – Transforms the current network into an AIG by one-level structural hashing. The resulting network is composed of two-input AND gates and inverters represented as complemented attributes on the edges.

2. bdd vs collapse
bdd – Converts only local functions of the nodes to BDDs.
collapse – Recursively composes the fanin nodes into the fanout nodes resulting in a network, in which each CO is produced by a node, whose fanins are CIs. Collapsing is performed by building global functions using BDDs and is, therefore, limited to relatively small circuits. After collapsing, the node functions are represented using BDDs.
